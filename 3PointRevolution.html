                This graph describes the 3 Pointer attempted per game from each season since the addition of it in 1979-78.
                At the beginning it seemed to be quite flat for a few years, the from 1985, there has been a gradual rise.
                And from 2012 a huge jump of the attempt per game was taken and now it lies at about 35 3PA per game,
                more than 7 times the number of attempts in 1980, in just 4 decades.

                Why is the 3 Pointer being taken so much?
            
        </h3>

        <br><br>

    <div class="explanation">
        <h5>
            <em>
                The reason I think which is responsible for this is due to the mass efficiency of the 3 point shot.
                Yes we all now 3 > 2, but that can only be presented if you can make the shot, or even if you are even going to take it.
            </em>
            <br><br><br><br>


            <div class="gallery">
                <img src="img/simpleMidEff.png" />
                <img src="img/simple3PEff.png" />
            </div>
            <br><br>



            When we compare 2 NBA the players, Kevin Durant and JaMychal Green, we can see that KD is much better in MidR% and and slightly better in 3P%.
            You should be able to infer just from these stats that KD is a much better shooter and would expect him to be a
            dramatically more efficient shooter than Green
            <br><br>

            <div class="gallery">
                    <img src="img/simplePPA.png" />
            </div>
            <br><br>

            However this is not the case, in terms of points per jump shot taken, KD lies on 1.15 and Green only lies 0.04 behind him,
            a very minor difference at 1.11/jump shot

            <br><br>

            <div class="gallery">
                    <img src="img/simplePercent3Pointer.png" />
                
            </div>
            <br><br>

            This can be explained in the proportions of Mid Range and 3 P taken by the 2 players.
            For KD, only 40% are 3 Pointers whereas for Green, 92.4% of his jump shots are 3 pointers,
            therefore giving him such a similar efficiency to KD.

            <br><br><br>

            In conclusion I think the reason there are so much more 3 point shots taken is due as stated at the start, its efficiency.
            The example of JaMychal Green further supports this as it suggest that even if you are not as great as a shooter like Curry,
            if you prioritise the 3 point shot, you will still be an efficient point scorer.
            <br><br>
            This does mean that the mid range in average has been taken less and less by NBA players but personally
            I don’t think it has died down and I don’t think it ever will. This is evident from superstars who thrive from the mid range such as Demar Derozan,
            who average 24.9 points/game and Kevin Durant, who averages 29.1 points/game
