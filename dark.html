                    <br><br>

                    then a <b>swollen knee</b> though he played through the swollen knee and came up with a very
                    physical performance against St Johns Leatherhead.
                    <br><br>
                    He has scored 2 tries this season and
                    created countless assists and huge tackles for the team.
                    <br><br>
                    During the 2022-2023 season, RGS went on bumpy 4-0-7 journey through out 11 games, scoring a total of 168 points(avg.15.3PTS/GAME),
                    against tough opponents, with each their unique playing style,
                    strength and weaknesses which has given the entire squad plenty of experiences for the years to come.

                        it is mostly casual play arounds but I have played in some tournaments outside and inside school for RGS, and now I gain advices
